# WSHOP

## Project

This RESTful API contains a list of 10 different shops (based on existing ones) with the following fields:

- id (uuid)
- name
- slogan (optional)
- type (relation)
- address
- opening hour
- closing hour

A type is only defined by an automatically incremented numeric ID and a label.

It is possible to:

- list all shops:
  - filters: name, type label and address
  - sorting: any field ascending or descending
- create a shop (the name's programmatically unique)
- update a shop
- delete a shop
